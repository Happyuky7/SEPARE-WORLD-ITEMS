# NOTE1

Because it is inside another folder, the reason is that the current version when this note, 
is that it is only a plugin version, it is planned to make a 
version natively compatible with Fabric and Forge soon.

### The current version of the plugin is partially compatible with MoHist (it has already been tested).
### Therefore it should be compatible with Banner or some other plugins + mods software, in Fabric or Forge.
